# arp-spoofing-detection
This repository contains a lightweight, engineer-oriented Python tool for detecting **ARP Spoofing** (ARP Poisoning) attacks in real time.   The program listens to ARP traffic using **Scapy** and alerts whenever an IP address suddenly changes its associated MAC address — a common indicator of **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** activity.
